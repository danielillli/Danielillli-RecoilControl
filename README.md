# Danielillli-RecoilControl
This script helps you control weapon recoil in games by automatically moving your mouse down when you shoot. Just run the script, adjust the recoil strength using the on-screen slider, and press your left mouse button like usual. The script smooths out your aim, making it easier to stay on target and improve your accuracy.
